# Sing a song
Project where we can add our favorite song and link for youtube to listen whenever we want and even compare with other people who added their favorite songs. The comparison is made based on the score of the music, in that way, the songs with the higher score will be considered the most popular songs. Besides, if a song get a score of -5 or less, sadly, she'll be deleted from our system.
